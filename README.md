# SodaPrice-Racial-Analysis
Analysis of fast food pricing and racial demographics using R.

This R project analyzes whether fast food restaurants charge higher prices for soft drinks in ZIP code areas with a higher percentage of Black residents, using data from New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It includes regression modeling, diagnostic testing, and interpretation of socioeconomic effects on pricing.

## Key Findings
Descriptive Statistics 
prpblck (proportion Black):

Mean: 0.113 (11.3%)

Standard deviation: 0.182

Unit: Percentage (%)

income:

Mean: $47,053.78

Standard deviation: $13,163.16

Unit: Dollars ($)

## Regression Analysis
Basic Model 
psoda = β₀ + β₁prpblck + β₂income + u

A $1 increase in income is associated with a $0.000001579 increase in soda price

R-squared: 0.06352

Sample size: 410 observations

p-value: 1.586e-06 (statistically significant)

## Log-Log Model 
log(psoda) = β₀ + β₁prpblck + β₂log(income) + u

1% increase in Black population → 0.12043% increase in soda price

1% increase in income → 0.07535% increase in soda price

R-squared: 0.06723

Preferred model based on lower AIC

## Correlation Analysis 
log(income) and prppov show high negative correlation (-0.838)

As expected: higher income generally associates with lower poverty

## Multicollinearity Check 
Despite high correlation between log(income) and prppov:

VIF values < 10 indicate no severe multicollinearity

## Final Model Selection 
The most reliable model is the extended log-log model with poverty rate (ols3) because:

Lowest AIC among alternatives

prpblck coefficient remains positive and significant

Suggests racial composition affects fast food pricing

## Assumption Validation 
Tests performed:
### Normality of residuals: Jarque-Bera test indicates issues
### Multicollinearity: VIF shows no problems
### Autocorrelation: Durbin-Watson test shows no issues
### Heteroskedasticity: White test shows no problems

# Interpretation
The analysis consistently shows that areas with higher Black populations tend to have higher fast food soda prices, even after controlling for income and poverty levels. This may indicate:

Economic exploitation by fast food chains

Different consumption patterns

Market dynamics in predominantly Black neighborhoods

The most robust model (log-log with poverty rate) suggests that a 1% increase in Black population is associated with approximately 0.12% higher soda prices, holding other factors constant.
